.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.br
.B echo "command" | ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a simple command line interpreter written in C. It can operate in both interactive and non-interactive modes and executes commands using their absolute path or by searching for them in the PATH environment variable.

In interactive mode, the shell displays a prompt 
.B ($) 
and waits for the user to enter a command. In non-interactive mode, the shell reads commands from standard input.

.SH OPTIONS
No options are supported.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit [status]
Exits the shell with a specified exit status. If no status is provided, uses the exit status of the last executed command.
.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables.

.SH OPERATION
The shell reads a line from standard input, checks if it's the 
.B exit
command, and if not, attempts to execute the command using 
.BR fork (2)
and 
.BR execve (2).

Commands can be specified with their absolute path (e.g., 
.B /bin/ls
) or simply by their name (e.g., 
.B ls
). In the latter case, the shell searches for the command in the directories listed in the 
.B PATH
environment variable.

.SH ERROR HANDLING
If a command is not found, the shell displays an error message in the format:
.br
.B program_name: command_number: command: not found

If a command is found but doesn't have execution permissions, the shell displays:
.br
.B program_name: command_number: command: Permission denied

The shell returns exit status 127 for commands not found and 126 for permission errors.

.SH EXAMPLES
Interactive mode:
.EX
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
shell.c shell.h README.md AUTHORS
($) /bin/pwd
/home/user/simple_shell
($) env
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
HOME=/home/user
($) exit 42
$
.EE

Non-interactive mode:
.EX
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
shell.c shell.h README.md AUTHORS
$ echo "exit" | ./hsh
$
.EE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success
.TP
.B 126
Permission denied
.TP
.B 127

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell uses the 
.B environ
environment variable to pass the environment to executed commands.
.br
The shell also uses the 
.B PATH
environment variable to search for commands that are not specified with an absolute path.

.SH FILES
