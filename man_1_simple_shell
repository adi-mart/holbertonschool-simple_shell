.TH HSH 1 "August 2025" "Version 1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
hsh \- simple shell, a basic UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command line interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.
.PP
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system. The shell implements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in addition to data storage, along with built in history and line editing capabilities.
.SH INVOCATION
.B hsh
can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively. If
.B hsh
is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes commands from standard input. When invoked with standard input connected to a terminal, an interactive shell is started.
.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
When
.B hsh
is executed interactively, it displays the prompt
.B "$ "
when it is ready to read a command. The shell then reads a line from the terminal, parses it into a command and arguments, and executes the command.
.SH NON-INTERACTIVE MODE
When
.B hsh
is executed non-interactively, it reads commands from standard input and executes them in sequence.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After receiving a command,
.B hsh
creates a child process to execute the command using
.BR fork (2)
and
.BR execve (2).
The parent process waits for the child to complete before reading the next command.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following commands are built into the shell:
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B hsh
returns the exit status of the last command executed, or zero if no command is executed.
